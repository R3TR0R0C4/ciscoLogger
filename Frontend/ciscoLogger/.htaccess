# Deny direct access to all files in this directory by default
Order Deny,Allow
Deny from all

# Allow access to PHP files (e.g., index.php, download.php)
# This rule overrides the 'Deny from all' for files ending in .php
<FilesMatch "\.php$">
    Order Allow,Deny
    Allow from all
</FilesMatch>

# Optional: If you have specific static files (like images, CSS, JS)
# that should be publicly accessible within this folder (e.g., for styling)
 <FilesMatch "\.(png||css|js)$">
     Order Allow,Deny
     Allow from all
 </FilesMatch>

# Remember that for any static files you want to serve securely (only to logged-in users),
# you should continue to use the PHP file serving script (like download.php)
# and keep them denied by the general 'Deny from all' rule.
